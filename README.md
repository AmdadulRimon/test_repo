## Install the Project

To get started with the portfolio website, you need to clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies. If you're not familiar with Git or Node.js, follow the steps below.

### Install Git

Git is a tool for downloading the project from GitHub. If you don’t have Git installed, here’s how you can get it:

1. **Download Git**: Go to the [Git download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. **Install Git**: Follow the instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - On Windows, run the installer and select the default settings.
   - On macOS, you may need to install Homebrew first and use `brew install git`.

    After installation, verify that Git is installed by opening a terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and typing:
     
    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

If you see a version number, Git is installed correctly.

### Install Node.js

Node.js is required to run the website locally. It also helps to manage project dependencies.

1. **Download Node.js**: Go to the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2. **Install Node.js**: Download the latest LTS version and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

   After installation, verify that Node.js is installed by opening a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and typing:

    ```bash
    node --version
    ```

    You should see a version number. Next, check if npm (Node's package manager) is installed by typing:

    ```bash
    npm --version
    ```

If both commands return version numbers, Node.js is set up correctly.
